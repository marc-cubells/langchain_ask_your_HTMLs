🔐 **Key Protection Tips**:

- Treat your API key as confidential. Unauthorized access to your key can compromise your OpenAI account and resources.
  
- Collaborate with your key only on platforms you trust.

- Employ distinct API keys for varying services to monitor your usage and detect any potential breaches.

- Make it a habit to assess your API key activities and retire those that aren't active.

### 2. Setting Up the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your system.
2. Rename ".env_example" to ".env" and replace the placeholder with your OpenAI API Key.
